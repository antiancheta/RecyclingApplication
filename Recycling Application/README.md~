I used two modules, time and Tkinter. Time was used to have things wait before moving on using the time.sleep() method and
Tkinter was the GUI side to this.

It's real easy to run. All you have to do is have access to the command line, or a Python interpreter, and run it via the
interpreter or the command 
	"python3 recycle.py".
or
	"./recycle"

YOU CAN NOT USE LOWER THAN PYTHON3 BECAUSE IT'S DUMB.
I plan on making adjustments, but this is the rough draft.

Bugs?
	- Only tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and higher (Linux)
	- Okay so when adding up the amount you've earned via your recyclables it throws a number like 0.10000000002 out there.
	- Also you can spam it, I'm gonna add a time.sleep() in there so they can't spam the functions.

Thanks I'm glad you recycle and chose to use my tool.
